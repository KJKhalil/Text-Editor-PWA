  ## Description
  This project was to create a simple text editor. A text editor that could be installed by the user on their device. This would allow them to have a text editor that they could use wether they are offline or online. (This application is still being worked on to make functional.)

  ## Installation
  To install the app you go to the deployed link which is https://text-editor-khalil.herokuapp.com/. You then hit the install button and enjoy a simple text editor even if your internet is down! Exciting.
